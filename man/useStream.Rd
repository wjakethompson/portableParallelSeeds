\title{Selects among available random streams.}
\usage{
useStream(n = NULL, origin = FALSE, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{An integer that selects which random stream should be used for the following work.}

\item{origin}{True or False. Should the stream be set at its original starting position, so as to re-generate the stream starting from the beginning? If FALSE, random numbers are drawn from the stream's current state.}

\item{verbose}{Requests detailed output for diagnostics.}
}
\value{
Nothing. This function is run to change environment variables.
}
\description{
R's global environment variable .Random.seed is re-set so that
random numbers generated after this call will follow from a
designated random number state. This will fail unless the
\code{setSeeds} function has already been called. This
function simply selects the n'th random stream for use,
presupposing that those stream states have already been set in the
global environment.
}
\details{
This should handle three chores.  1) Copy the existing state of
the random generator (.Random.seed) into
currentStates[[currentStream]]. That allows us to "go back" to
that generator when we want to.  2) Change currentStream variable
to n, then 3) Re-set R's .Random.seed variable to the value from
currentStates[[currentStream]], so that successively drawn random
numbers follow the proper generator.
