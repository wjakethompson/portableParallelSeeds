Title: Allow replication of simulations on parallel and serial
    computers.
Type: Package
Author: Paul E. Johnson <pauljohn@ku.edu>
Description: Creates seeds for simulation projects.  Uses the L'Eucyer
   "many separate streams" approach to allow users to create one or
   more unique streams per simulation run.  Can save, reload, and
   select among streams of random numbers for arbitrarily many
   projects.  From a batch of thousands of simulations, one can select
   any arbitrary "run" of the model and re-initialize it (replicate
   it) in isolation. The book-keeping work is done in an enviroment
   called ".pps". This simulation will alter the state of the user
   session's .RandomSeed variable so as to re-initialize a simulation
   exactly. This was developed on a Linux cluster for replication of
   simulations across many compute nodes, but it is also compatible
   with iteration on a single computer. Includes vignettes to explain
   some basics of the package and the usage of pseudo-random number
   generators (PRNG).
