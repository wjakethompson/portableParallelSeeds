Description: Creates seeds for simulation projects.  Uses the
    L'Eucyer "many separate streams" approach to allow users to create one
    or more unique streams per simulation run.  Can save, reload, and
    select among streams of random numbers for arbitrarily many projects.
    From a batch of thousands of simulations, one can select any arbitrary
    "run" of the model and re-initialize it (replicate it) in isolation.
    The book-keeping work is done in an enviroment called ".pps". This
    simulation will alter the state of the user session's .RandomSeed
    variable so as to re-initialize a simulation exactly. This was
    developed on a Linux cluster for replication of simulations across
    many compute nodes, but it is also compatible with iteration on a
    single computer. Includes vignettes to explain some basics of the
    package and the usage of pseudo-random number generators (PRNG).
